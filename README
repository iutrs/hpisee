Simple proof of concept implementation of an HP ISEE (Instant Support
Enterprise Edition) client. It supports client registration and
entitlement/warranty lookup.

Usage:   $0 serial,prod,[country] [serial,prod,[country] ...]
Example: $0 CZ10130050,519841-425,ES

The client looks for API auth data in ~/.hpiseeauth. If it's not
found, it registers with the API and stores the credentials in
~/.hpiseeauth for later use and then runs the warranty lookup.
